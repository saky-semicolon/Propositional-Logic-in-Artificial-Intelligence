<img src="media_files/cover.png" style="align:centre">

## Learning Outcome:
<i>At the end of the class, students should be able to:</i>

* Define primitive statements <br>
* Form a compound statements <br>
* define negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, tautology, contradiction and contingency statements. <br>
* construct truth table. <br>

## LOGICAL CONNECTIVES
<i>Main components of symbolic logic are:</i> <br>

- Proposition/Statements
- Connectives

## PROPOSITION/STATEMENTS

- A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false.
- The truth or falsify of a statement is called truth value.
- Usually denoted by letters p, q, r, s and so on.
<i>Example:</i>

✔ You will be late to school if you miss the bus; <br>
✔ Ms. Nina will have a broader audience next month;<br>
✔ I did not join the competition;<br>
✔ Today is Monday;<br>
✔ I love reading thriller books;<br>
✔ The number 3 is an odd integer;<br>

## Logical connectives and compound statements

| <b>Logical Connective</b> | <b>Compound statement</b> | <b>Symbolic compound statement</b> |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| ∧  | p and q (conjunction)  | p ∧ q  |
| ∨ | p or q (disjunction)  | p ∨ q  |
| →  | if p then q (conditional/implication)  | p → q  |
| ↔ | p if and only if q (biconditional)  | p ↔ q  |
